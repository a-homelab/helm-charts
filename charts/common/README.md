# common

Component-oriented Helm library chart. A consumer chart declares **components**
(workloads) and **extras** (chart-scoped resources) entirely through values;
its whole `templates/` directory is one line:

```yaml
{{- include "common.all" . }}
```

## Design

### Top-level values keys

```yaml
global:      # injected platform context (gateway, domain, secret store)
defaults:    # component-shaped defaults merged under every component
components:  # named workloads; empty -> one implicit component "main"
extras:      # chart-scoped resources: extras.<type>.<name>
labels:      # stamped on every rendered resource (pods included)
annotations: # stamped on every rendered resource (pods excluded)
# plus the familiar Helm keys: nameOverride, fullnameOverride, namespaceOverride
```

Keys inside a component mirror the Kubernetes ownership model — container
fields live under `container`, pod fields under `pod`, controller fields
under the block matching `kind` (`deployment`, `statefulset`, `cronjob`, ...),
and each per-component resource (`service`, `httpRoute`, `hpa`, `pdb`,
`serviceAccount`) has its own block. If you know where a field lives in the
k8s API, you know where it lives in values.

### Resolution

Each component resolves through a layered deep-merge:

```
libraryDefaults  <-  .Values.defaults  <-  .Values.components.<name>
```

- Later layers win, **including `false`, `0` and `""`** (unlike sprig's
  `mergeOverwrite`).
- Explicit **null deletes**: any layer can remove a whole resource
  (`service: ~`), a map entry (`env.DEPRECATED: ~`), or prune a derived
  entry (`service.ports.http: ~`).
- The library's own defaults only contain values that work standalone.
  Required-by-nature fields (`container.image.repository`,
  `cronjob.schedule`) have **no default** and fail fast with a clear error.
- The component named `main` renders resources as `<fullname>`; every other
  component as `<fullname>-<name>`. Declaring any component replaces the
  implicit `main`.

### Maps, not arrays

Every collection whose entries have identity is a map: `env`, `ports`,
`volumes`, `mounts`, `sidecars`, `initContainers`, `tolerations`,
`parentRefs`, `extras.*`, ... Map keys give entries identity across layers
and values files (add/override/delete individual entries from an overlay);
rendering converts maps to deterministically ordered lists (sorted by
optional `weight`, then key), so manifests are byte-stable and GitOps diffs
never churn. Arrays remain only where order is semantic (`command`, `args`,
`httpRoute.rules`) or for raw k8s passthrough (`affinity`, `hpa.behavior`).

### Derived wiring

Cross-resource plumbing is computed at render time, never stored in values:

- Service ports mirror the union of all containers' named ports
  (service-side port = `expose | port`); no ports -> no Service.
- HTTPRoute hostnames default to `<name>.<global.domain>`, parentRefs to
  `global.gateway`, rules to one catch-all whose backendRef targets the
  component's Service and first port.
- `serviceAccountName`, PVCs from `volumes.type: pvc`, probe ports by port
  name, selector labels — all automatic.

### Metadata rules

1. Selector labels are locked: exactly `name` + `instance` + `component`
   (always, also for `main`), never merged with user labels.
2. Volatile generated labels (`helm.sh/chart`, `version`) stay off pod
   templates, so a chart version bump alone never rolls pods.
3. Top-level `annotations` never touch pod templates; pod annotations come
   only from `pod.annotations` (tpl-rendered — checksums go here).
4. Top-level `labels` reach everything, pods included.

Cascade (later wins): generated -> top-level -> component -> resource.

### Escape hatches, three altitudes

Every resource block accepts `overrides:` — tpl-rendered and deep-merged
onto the rendered manifest. Crucially, `container.overrides` and
`pod.overrides` apply **before** containers are assembled into lists, so
any container/pod field the library doesn't model is still reachable
(deep-merge cannot patch list elements, so patching happens pre-assembly).
For entire resource types the library doesn't model, use
`extras.rawResource.<name>` — full manifests that still get standard
labels and tpl rendering.

## Minimal consumer

```yaml
# values.yaml — a complete single-app chart
components:
  main:
    container:
      image:
        repository: lscr.io/linuxserver/sonarr
      env:
        TZ: America/Chicago
      ports:
        http:
          port: 8989
    pod:
      volumes:
        config:
          type: pvc
          size: 1Gi
          mounts:
            /config: {}
    httpRoute:
      enabled: true      # hostname: <fullname>.<global.domain>
```

Renders Deployment, Service, ServiceAccount, HTTPRoute and PVC, fully wired.

## Multi-component

```yaml
defaults:                # shared across all components
  pod:
    securityContext:
      runAsNonRoot: true

components:
  api:
    container:
      image: { repository: ghcr.io/example/app }
      ports: { http: { port: 8080 } }
    sidecars:
      oauth-proxy:
        image: { repository: quay.io/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy, tag: v7.6.0 }
        ports: { proxy: { port: 4180, expose: 80 } }
    httpRoute: { enabled: true }
  worker:
    container:
      image: { repository: ghcr.io/example/app }
      command: [./worker]
    service: ~           # delete the inherited Service
```

## Testing

The sibling [`common-tests`](../common-tests/) harness chart depends on this
chart via `file://../common`:

```sh
helm dependency update charts/common-tests
helm template t charts/common-tests                                        # single-app
helm template t charts/common-tests -f charts/common-tests/ci/multi-component-values.yaml
helm template t charts/common-tests -f charts/common-tests/ci/controllers-values.yaml
```

## Status / roadmap

v1.0.0-alpha: Deployment, StatefulSet (incl. volumeClaimTemplates),
DaemonSet, CronJob, Job; Service, HTTPRoute, HPA, PDB, ServiceAccount;
extras: configMap, secret, externalSecret, pvc, rawResource.

Planned: values.schema.json (generated), NetworkPolicy, ServiceMonitor,
GRPCRoute/TCPRoute/TLSRoute, `extras` component back-references
(`component: api` to borrow selectors), helm-unittest suite in CI,
migration of existing app charts.
